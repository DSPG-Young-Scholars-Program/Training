# Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks within this repository require **Python 3**.
You have two options:

1. Install Python 3 system wide
2. Create a virtual environment
    + In an Ubuntu Linux variant: `virtualenv . -p python3`

Once the environment is created, activate it by running
```
source bin/activate
```
Then, install the python dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can launch the notebooks by firing up Jupyter with:
```
jupyter notebook
```
