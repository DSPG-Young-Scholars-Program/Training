# Web Scraping

We will cover the following cases:

- Static websites will use the [`rvest`](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) package

- Dynamic websites will use [`RSelenium`](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) an R client for [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) Remote Webdriver

For websites that implement an application programming interface (API),

- [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) will use [`httr`](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) will use [`ghql`](https://github.com/ropensci/ghql)

Other special cases,

- Files
- HTML tables
